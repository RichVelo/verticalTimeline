                    <p>After a great deal of thought I decided I needed to change my job. I learnt a lot from the role as Adjusicator,  but I no longer enjoyed it as I once did. So I gave my 30 days notice on this date to leave the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS).</p>

                    <p>From the end of May 2022 to the present day I have been applying and interviewing for my first dev role. It's taking a little longer than I hoped but I have time to also learn more and improve my skills and portfolio. I am so much happier having undertaken this monumental life change and just have not looked back.</p>
